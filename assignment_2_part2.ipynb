    "# PROJECT PLAN\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data description:\n",
    " The data for this project is sourced from 2 kaggle datasets titled \"Global Data science Salary trends\" and \"Cybersecurity salaries\" . Both of these dataset provides comprehensive information on the salaries of data-related and cybersecurity-related roles from around the world spanning over the period (2020-2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of aims and objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "Aim: The primary goal of this project is to explore and analyse global salary trends within data science and cybersecurity then comparing them, and by answering the main question on which field pays more and is likely to pay more in the future based on the data we have now. By delving into these datasets, the project aims to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Conduct an exploratory analysis to identify the hierarchy of data roles ranking them from most least popular across the globe.\n",
    "2. Create visual representation ranking data roles from highest to lowest salaries.\n",
    "3. Visualise the variations of salary within these data roles over times to trace and observe any important trends and shifts from 2020 to 2022\n"

    "# THE DATA:\n",
    "Both Datasets used provide comprehensive information on the salaries of data-related and cyber-related roles from around the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets have the same columns with different information including:\n",
    "- work_year: The year at when the employee was working\n",
    "- experience_level: EN Entry-level / Junior MI Mid-level / Intermediate SE Senior-level / -Expert EX Executive-level / Director\n",
    "- employment_type: PT Part-time FT Full-time CT Contract FL Freelance\n",
    "- job_title: The specific job role\n",
    "- salary: The gross salary.\n",
    "- salary_currency: The currency of the salary paid.\n",
    "- salary in usd: The salary in USD (FX rate divided by avg. USD rate for the respective year via fxdata.foorilla.com).\n",
    "- employee_residence: Employee's country of residence in during the work year \n",
    "- remote_ratio: The overall amount of work done remotely, possible values are as follows: 0 No remote work (less than 20%) 50 Partially remote 100 Fully remote (more than 80%)\n",
    "- company_location: The country of the employer's office\n",
    "- company_size: S (small), M employees (medium) L more than 250 employees (large)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data quality and Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some uncertainties and considerations associated with our dataset:\n",
    "- The criteria for small, medium or large company according to the dataset is not clearly defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "- dataset does not specify whether \"company_location\" means the company's main office/headquarters or the employee's work location.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is some ambiguity surrounding the nature of the employees' experiences, especially regarding how long they have been at their registered company.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dataset does not account for the employees' diverse skill sets, which could have been further interpreted as a salary determinant.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Having the same job title does not mean identical job responsiblities or tasks, thus, differences in salaries can exist within the same job title.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dataset's reliability can be questioned too, especially if it was self-reported. This could lead to biases and tendencies to inflate/deflate certain figures\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these uncertainties, the dataset still provides a wealth of information enough to take an introductory step towards the analysis of global data science job market trends. Steps within the data architecture section mention the steps taken to refine our dataset and make it ready for analysis.\n",

    "In today's digital age, information about tech jobs can be found everywhere, from Linkedin to social media to blogs and more.

    "Objective 1: Correlate and visualize average salaries by job titles in the fields of Data Science and Cybersecurity, highlighting variations based on company size, experience levels, and employment types.\n",
    "Objective 2: Provide a global perspective by charting the trend of salaries based on employee residence, emphasizing top locations with the highest average salaries.\n",
    "Objective 3: Analyze and showcase the impact of remote work on salaries within the Data Science and Cybersecurity fields."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive Statistics: Essential statistics, including mean, median and standard deviation helped offer a snapshot of data distribution.\n",
    "Visualization: Graphical representation helped in visualising these data distributions, correlations and evolving trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Building (if predictive analytics is desired): Create statistical models.\n",
    "Insights Extraction: Derive actionable insights based on patterns or trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Reporting and Visualization:\n",

Particularly in DS, the upward trend is a little more prominent, showing a consistent demand for their roles. In the cyber security field, whilst there is a similar rise, there is an intriguing narrowing of the gap with medium companies towards 2022, suggesting possible shifts in market dynamics or a growth in demand within the medium-sized sector.\n",

    "We also see a notable volatile trend in both DS and CS roles for medium-sized companies (orange line). Interestingly both salaries dip between 2020 and 2021, this could potentially be influenced by the pandemic as medium sized/small-sized companies find it harder to maintain themselves during global crises with their limited resources and are more susceptible to resorting to lay-offs as means of survival. Again, we interestingly see an immensely sharp recovery in both sectors with a fast salary growth from 2021 to 2022 , with CS roles even edging out the big enterprises. These graphs whilst optimistic, requires a closer examination for the outliers or high-demand roles as they could disproportionately influence the average. \n",

Conversely, smaller firms may not have the same need for roles like DevOps or other maintenance job titles like data architect , which are more common in large corporate infrastructures.e nature of the roles that have higher distribution within small companies, are specialised roles like machine le arning engineer, or data scientist where their skills can be of demand as small companies have to catch up to big companies and is safe to assume that they require cutting edge stuff so they can survive in the market and they also don't really need roles like devops or maintanance roles that are required in big companiesR"

    "### Achievements:\n",
    "Throughout this project I successfully managed to understand various relationships on salary for tech roles and shown it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) General Trend Analysis: both fields in Data Science & Cyber Security have shown an increase in average salaries from 2020 to 2022. the fall from 2020 to 2021 could have been due to covid as summarized in our analysis. and Has increased back to 2022 this could be several factors including digital transformation many companies underwent during the pandemic, increase in AI, as well as increase in cyber security threats.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Larger companies consistently have offered higher salaries in both Data Science and Cyber security roles overall, however it was interesting to find that the salaries in 2022 for big enterprise and medium companies were very small, this narrow gap in salary could be due to potential market shift or increase in demand in medium size companies, to undergo a strong digital transformation which could again due to the pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Filtering job titles that occur less frequently helps compare roles more reliably, since we have more data of that particular role. Visualizing average salaries by job provided a strong insights into which roles are paid the most on average, while the distribution across experience levels helps understand which experience levels are most common for high-paying roles.\n",
    "Distribution across Employment type was evident and clear that most of these (98%) being full-time for the high paying tech roles and there was no further observation or comparison to other employment type\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Visualizing salary trends based on employees' location offers insights into regional disparities and how they change over time. The choropleth maps give a detailed view of the global distribution of salaries based on experience level, and the bar charts focus on the top-paying countries, allowing for a comparison of how these rankings change year by year."

    "Data scope: the analysis is limited to 2020 to 2022, trends prior to or after this period are not covered, which therefore doesn't provide a clearer picture for tech roles in the longer duration in order to examine more information and see other possible relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "The geographical coverage: while the the dataset offers a global tech jobs, there is still limitation in terms of specific regions within a country or not accounting for some accounting for som countries around the world\n",
    "\n",
    "The sources of data collection might have inherent biases. For instance, self-reported salaries can sometimes be inflated or under-reported, potentially skewing the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "External factors including Industry comparison, analysing job titles across different industries such as Finance, Business, Healthcare, Defence and technology. This can provide a strong insight for salary\n",
    "\n",
    "Variability in Job Titles: Different companies might have different titles for similar roles, which might lead to discrepancies when categorizing and analyzing these roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Skills: Analysing skills set of employees can also provide a strong insight into the market value for different job expertise. Salaries highly depends on the role specification and task involved, for instance the more technical skills the more likely the salary will be high. \n",

    "### Future Work:\n",
    "Despite these limitations this project enacts as one step forward to observing nuanced insights on job market dynamics. By exploring the relationships between various factors and salary determinants and visualising it for job seekers can help equip them with a clearer understanding of wage trends in their desired industry , eliminating the need for rigorous manual research. Perhaps platforms like Linkedin or Indeed could potentially utilise these insights to enhance their user experience, offering more targeted and relevant job suggestions based on these observed trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other recommendations to improve this data analysis could be done by:\n",
    "- Increasing Timeframe: Use data from a more extended period to identify long-term trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Focusing on specific regions or countries to provide a more specific view of salary trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Incorporating Additional Data Points: Introduce more variables like education levels, specific skill sets, or tools proficiency to provide a richer analysis on salary determinants.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Machine Learning Predictions: Utilize machine learning algorithms to forecast future salary trends based on historical and current data."
